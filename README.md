  <em>I spent months applying to jobs the hard way. So I engineered the system I wish I had.</em><br>
  Companies use AI to filter candidates. <strong>I just gave candidates AI to <em>choose</em> companies.</strong><br>
  <em>Now it's open source.</em>

## What Is This

Career-Ops turns any AI coding CLI into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a structured A-F scoring system (10 weighted dimensions)
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Processes in batch** -- evaluate 10+ offers in parallel with sub-agents
- **Tracks everything** in a single source of truth with integrity checks

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career-ops is a filter -- it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable, and so is the recruiter's. Always review before submitting.

Career-ops is agentic: Claude Code navigates career pages with Playwright, evaluates fit by reasoning about your CV vs the job description (not keyword matching), and adapts your resume per listing.

> **Heads up: the first evaluations won't be great.** The system doesn't know you yet. Feed it context -- your CV, your career story, your proof points, your preferences, what you're good at, what you want to avoid. The more you nurture it, the better it gets. Think of it as onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.

Built by someone who used it to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. [Read the full case study](https://santifer.io/career-ops-system).

## 60-Second Start (for @ariacodez viewers)

The fastest path from clone to first auto-applied job:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AKCodez/career-ops.git
cd career-ops
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run doctor     # tells you exactly what's missing
```

Then open Claude Code and paste this one sentence:

> `onboard me for career-ops — I'm [role you're targeting], based in [city]. My CV is pasted below.\n\n[paste CV]`

Claude fills in `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, and `portals.yml` for you. No template-editing, no YAML wrangling.

When you want to apply:

```
/career-ops submit <job-posting-url>
```

Claude opens Chrome in a new tab, fills every field (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, long-form "Why us?" answers, dropdowns for visa / work-auth / location), pastes a tailored cover letter, and **stops before Submit**. You upload the resume PDF (one click), review the form, and hit Submit yourself. You stay in the loop for every decision.

**What you need once:**
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/download) (desktop or CLI)
- [Claude in Chrome extension](https://claude.com/download) (for the `submit` mode only)
- Your CV in any format (markdown, PDF, LinkedIn export — Claude converts it)

**Everything else** — tailored per-role CVs, application answers, tracker updates, portal scanning — is handled for you.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-Pipeline** | Paste a URL, get a full evaluation + PDF + tracker entry |
| **6-Block Evaluation** | Role summary, CV match, level strategy, comp research, personalization, interview prep (STAR+R) |
| **Interview Story Bank** | Accumulates STAR+Reflection stories across evaluations -- 5-10 master stories that answer any behavioral question |
| **Negotiation Scripts** | Salary negotiation frameworks, geographic discount pushback, competing offer leverage |
| **ATS PDF Generation** | Keyword-injected CVs with Space Grotesk + DM Sans design |
| **Portal Scanner** | 45+ companies pre-configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Retool, n8n...) + custom queries across Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever, Wellfound |
| **Batch Processing** | Parallel evaluation with `claude -p` workers |
| **Dashboard TUI** | Terminal UI to browse, filter, and sort your pipeline |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | AI evaluates and recommends, you decide and act. The system never submits an application -- you always have the final call |
| **Browser Auto-Apply** | `/career-ops submit <url>` — Claude in Chrome fills every form field (basic info, dropdowns, long-form answers, cover letter) and stops before Submit. You upload the PDF and click. |
| **Zero-Token JD Fetch** | `fetch-jd.mjs` hits Ashby / Greenhouse / Lever APIs directly. No WebFetch cost, no "Ashby only returns title" problem. |
| **Per-Role Tailored CVs** | `tailor-cv.mjs` takes a role-config YAML and generates an ATS-clean HTML → PDF with role-specific summary, proof points, and competencies |
| **Pipeline Integrity** | Automated merge, dedup, status normalization, health checks |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/santifer/career-ops.git
cd career-ops && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # Required for PDF generation

# 2. Check setup
npm run doctor                     # Validates all prerequisites

# 3. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies

# 4. Add your CV
# Create cv.md in the project root with your CV in markdown

# 5. Personalize with Claude
claude   # Open Claude Code in this directory

# Then ask Claude to adapt the system to you:
# "Change the archetypes to backend engineering roles"
# "Translate the modes to English"
# "Add these 5 companies to portals.yml"
# "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting"

# 6. Start using
# Paste a job URL or run /career-ops
```

> **The system is designed to be customized by Claude itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts -- just ask Claude to change them. It reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

## Usage

Career-ops is a single slash command with multiple modes:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Live answer generator (you copy-paste into the form)
/career-ops submit <url>   → Browser-automated form fill (pauses before Submit)
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → LinkedIn outreach message
/career-ops deep           → Deep company research
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.
